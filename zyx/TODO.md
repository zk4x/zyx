  - [ ] cuda
    - [ ] fix async memcopy
    - [ ] tensor cores
  - [ ] hip
  - [x] opencl
  - [ ] vulkan
  - [ ] wgpu
  - [ ] dummy
- [ ] dtype
  - [ ] quantized dtypes
- [x] runtime
  - [x] graph size optimization - remove axes from Nodes, put it into map like shapes and dtypes
- [x] scheduler
  - [x] cache Map<(Kernel, Optimizations), Program> instead of Map<IRKernel, Program>
  - [ ] fix reshape node
    - [x] merges, splits, reshapes of non reduce axes
    - [ ] inserting new loops to the end of the kernel
  - [ ] pad should also work even with kernels that store stuff, just pad the store view
  - [x] expand reduce bug
  - [ ] tests for fusion, test will create it's own graph and check how the fused kernel looks
    - [ ] softmax fusion test (eventually should be single kernel)
    - [ ] just asserts that various graphs fuse into single kernel
  - [ ] scheduling to multiple devices
  - [ ] automatic sharding across devices
- [x] kernel
  - [x] ops remove unary view
  - [x] ops remove binary views
- [ ] optimizer
  - [ ] default optimizations
  - [ ] register tiling of all variables
  - [ ] local tiling of all variables
  - [ ] better picking of next optimization, or even optimization search
  - [ ] flash attention

  - [x] add dtype to load vop, so that we don't need to pass graph to ir
  - [x] do not pass graph to ir
  - [x] change ir register id to u16
  - [x] remove ref counting from ir
