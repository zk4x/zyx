- [ ] tests for fusion in generate kernels, test will create it's own graph and check how the fused kernel looks
    - [ ] softmax fusion test
- [ ] finish view
  - [x] split on padded view
  - [x] view padding to ir
    - [x] offset
    - [x] padding condition
  - [ ] view reshaped to ir
  - [ ] view axis merge
- [ ] ir rewrite
  - [x] add dtype to load vop, so that we don't need to pass graph to ir
  - [x] do not pass graph to ir
  - [x] change ir register id to u16
  - [x] remove ref counting from ir
  - [ ] merge all mul + add into mad instructions
  - [ ] add ops reordering, all ops that can be moved before loops should be moved
  - [ ] deduplicate all calculations
  - [ ] add optimizations for ops, merges, deletion of redundant ops
  - [x] add new reference counting that accounts for all variables, including indexing variables
- [x] vops remove unary view
- [x] vops remove binary views
- [x] manual for adding new backends
- [ ] cache Map<(Kernel, Optimizations), Program> instead of Map<IRKernel, Program>
- [ ] register tiling of all variables
- [ ] local tiling of all variables
- [ ] vector dtypes in kernels
- [ ] tensor cores support
- [ ] matmul
- [ ] flash attention
- [ ] graph size optimization - remove axes from Nodes, put it into map like shapes and dtypes
