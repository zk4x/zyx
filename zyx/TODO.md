- [ ] tests for fusion in generate kernels, test will create it's own graph and check how the fused kernel looks
    - [ ] softmax fusion test
- [ ] finish view
  - [x] split on padded view
  - [x] view padding to ir
    - [x] offset
    - [x] padding condition
  - [ ] view reshaped to ir
  - [ ] view axis merge
- [ ] ir rewrite
  - [x] add dtype to load vop, so that we don't need to pass graph to ir
  - [ ] do not pass graph to ir
  - [x] change ir register id to u16
  - [ ] remove ref counting from ir
  - [ ] add ops reordering, all ops that can be moved before loops should be moved
  - [ ] deduplicate all calculations
  - [ ] add function optimizations
  - [ ] add new reference counting that accounts for all variables, including indexing variables
